            <p>Hi, my name is Bernard Xie. I am currently a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I grew up in the megacity of Shanghai, China, but I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I started to build this website in July, 2014, with the purpose of having it as a little personal project to help jumpstart my interests and abilities in web development. As I have gone on to improve this website, I have found it rather useful to further showcase my other interests as well.
            <br/><br/>
            Originally slated to study Neuroscience on the Pre-Medicine track as a freshman, I was however always more of a person who wanted to be someone that could build new and interesting things and pursue creative ideas. This passion eventually overtook my interest in Medicine, and I transferred to USC's renowned Viterbi School of Engineering so I could study Computer Science and to learn the skills that would eventually help me fulfill this passion. The creation of this website was a testament to that continued desire.
            <br/><br/>
            My professional interests today include social entrepreneurship, start-ups, web development, app development and graphic design, amongst others. I am hoping to being able to shape my professional goals with those interests in the future. Other interests I have include traveling, sports, cars, food, teaching, trivia and Chinese culture, which are subjects I can probably talk endlessly about.
            <br/><br/>
            Please do not hesitate to contact me under the 'Contact Me' section of this website. Thank you very much for visiting!
