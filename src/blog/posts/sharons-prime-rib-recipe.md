## Ingredients

### Main
- **Prime rib**, boneless from Costco is easiest (7.5 lbs fed 7 people, but with side dishes included and appetites were not ENORMOUS)
- **Butcher's twine**/sturdy string
- **Coarse seasoning** (McCormick's brown butter garlic seasoning or Kinder's prime rib rub) - enough to coat the entire prime rib
- **Salt, pepper, garlic powder** (tons of these), dried oregano, dried thyme, Italian spice (less of these)
- **Large baking pan** with at least 2-3 inch tall sides
- **Meat thermometer** that can be set and read from outside oven if available (manual one will do too)

### For the Jus
- 2 garlic bulbs
- 1 whole onion
- 1 shallot
- 3-5 carrots
- 3-4 celery stalks
- 4 bay leaves
- 3 cups beef stock

### Optional
- Fresh rosemary and thyme
- Horseradish sauce (I got Beaver brand from Safeway - it's potent & a bit spicy!)

## Preparation (Day Prior)

### Tie the Meat
Pull prime rib out of fridge and place onto baking sheet. Make 4-5 ties (2.5 inches apart) using butcher's knot to maintain shape of meat (a butcher's shop can do this step for you, but Costco won't).

### Dry Brine
1. Pat meat dry with paper towel
2. Place on baking rack on top of large sheet tray
3. Use ample coarse seasoning, additional salt, garlic powder, and onion powder (you probably can't go overboard due to the sheer size of the meat - just be generous)
4. Pat all the seasoning onto entire surface of prime rib
5. Place entire rib, **uncovered**, in fridge to dry brine for the next **12-24 hours**
6. Don't need to add pepper until next day

## Preparation (Day Of)

### Thaw Meat
**4-5 hours prior to baking** (morning of big dinner), take rib out of fridge to reach room temp. This is important in ensuring the most even cook throughout the meat. The larger the meat, the longer it will take to warm from fridge temp.

### Preheat Oven
Preheat oven to **250°F** around 4 hours prior to dinner time.

### Final Coating
While oven is heating, freshly crack black pepper and generously coat entire prime rib surface for final crust. Can also add a bit more salt and garlic powder if you did not season overnight.

### Prep Jus Base
At bottom of pan, place:
- 2 onion halves
- 4 garlic halves
- 2 shallot halves
- Very roughly chopped celery
- Carrots
- Fresh thyme, rosemary

This forms an elevated bed. Drizzle oil on top. Place entire prime rib on top of bedding so it sits evenly in the center.

## Cooking (Day Of)

### Initial Bake
Bake prime rib for **2.5-3 hours** depending on oven strength, initial meat temperature, and meat size.

**Target temperatures:**
| Doneness | Internal Temp |
|----------|---------------|
| Medium rare (rarer side) | 115-118°F |
| Medium rare (medium side) | 120-123°F |

**If using smart thermometer:** Set the temp range for the low end of your goal and pull out soon after.

**If using manual thermometer:** Start checking middle of meat temp around the 2 hour mark and keep checking every 7-8 minutes for the rate of increase. Once at 105°F, it took my prime rib another ~30 min or so to get to 115°F.

### Rest the Meat
1. Once goal temp reached, pull entire pan out of oven
2. Place just the prime rib onto cooling rack or new sheet pan/plate
3. **Crank oven up to 500°F** (takes a while)
4. Cover prime rib with large piece of foil **very loosely** (gaps OK)
5. Let it rest at room temp for **30-60 minutes** (no more) to ensure juices reabsorb into meat

### Make the Jus
While oven is heating:
1. Pour all remaining vegetables, scraps & meat juices from bottom of baking pan into a sauce pan
2. Heat on medium heat on stove
3. Season with Italian spice, dried oregano, salt, pepper
4. Add **3 cups of beef stock**
5. Allow to simmer for **10-15 min** until thicker
6. Pour through a strainer into serving bowl

✅ **Jus complete!**

### Reverse Sear
1. After letting prime rib rest, place into **500°F oven for 5-10 minutes** to create a seared crust and deeper flavor
2. Once out of oven, can rest for 10 min (or not)
3. Place onto cutting board with side grooves to catch all the meat juices
4. Cut all the string
5. Use steak knife to cut rib into **¾ to 1 inch thick slabs**
6. Serve with jus and any other sides of your choosing

## Tips

### For Maximum Flavor
For maximum flavor that penetrated even the middle of the rib, I started the dry brine the **morning BEFORE** the night of the dinner:
- Bought prime rib Friday evening
- Dry brine Saturday morning through Sunday morning
- Baked Sunday afternoon
- Ate Sunday dinner

### Bone-In vs Boneless
For the least amount of meat handling, I did not trim any fat off and bought boneless rib. If you choose to get a **bone-in rib** (which is heavier and gives an extra piece of juicy baby back rib at the end!), it's preferred to buy from a butcher's shop so you can ask the butcher to cut off the bone and retie it back onto the rib for the most even cook. (May need to follow a separate recipe online for more details!)

### Pairing Suggestions
- **Horseradish sauce** gives a fresh kick (can be spicy if you pick Beaver brand) to the fatty piece of meat
- **Jus** is optional - if not making it, just bake the rib on an elevated rack over the large baking pan and you can collect the drippings. BUT jus is great for pouring all that flavor and moisture back onto the meat. Also goes great with sides!

### Side Dish Ideas
- Fresh salad
- Buttered corn
- Air fried potatoes/veg (since oven will be occupied pretty much all day)
- Mashed potatoes
- Cheesy garlic bread (Costco - super easy and yummy via air fryer)
