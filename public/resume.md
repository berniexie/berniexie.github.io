### Asana

**Senior Software Engineer** | November 2023 – April 2025

- Led a 10-month, 3-engineer enterprise permissions initiative (Custom Field Permissions) to GA 1.5 months ahead of schedule, now adopted by 37 of the Top 100 enterprise accounts, by solo-owning the most complex milestone and coordinating across 4+ platform teams.

- Served as Project Engineering Lead (PEL) for Permissions in Automations, driving end-to-end delivery through crisp planning, stakeholder communication, and early risk mitigation on a high-urgency, complex feature.

- Accelerated team velocity by authoring a timeline planning methodology that eliminated arbitrary buffers, later adopted by other workstreams, and creating robust testing plans leveraged across multiple releases.

- Mentored two L3 engineers through structured 1:1s, code reviews, and pairing—directly contributing to one engineer's promotion to L4 through rigorous evaluation and advocacy.

- Scaled cross-team collaboration by authoring an engineering partnership rolodex and collaboration guidelines, enabling faster unblocking and reducing dependency friction across the organization.
